# Data Collection

The data collection scripts are located under:

```
chatbot-core/data/collection/
```

These scripts gather information from four key sources:
- **Jenkins official documentation**
- **Discourse community topics**
- **StackOverflow threads**
- **Jenkins Plugins documentation**

This doc file describes how to run the individual data collection scripts for each source. The results will be stored in the `raw` directory.

---

## Jenkins Documentation

The script `docs_crawler.py` recursively crawls the [Jenkins official documentation](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/) starting from the base URL. It collects the main content from each documentation page and stores it in a structured JSON file.

- **Input**: No input required — the script starts crawling from the base documentation URL.
- **Output**: A `jenkins_docs.json` file saved under `chatbot-core/data/raw/`, containing page URLs as keys and their HTML content as values.

**To run:**

```bash
python data/collection/docs_crawler.py
```

> **Note**: Make sure you're in the chatbot-core directory and your virtual environment is activated before running this or any script.

## Discourse Topics

This data collection pipeline fetches community discussions from the [Jenkins Discourse forum](https://community.jenkins.io) under the "Using Jenkins" category. It runs in **three steps**, using separate scripts:

### 1. Fetch topic list

**Script**: `discourse_topics_retriever.py`

Fetches all topics under the "Using Jenkins" category(including sub-category "Ask a question").

- **Input**: None — it exploits the Discourse API.
- **Output**: `discourse_topic_list.json` (stored in `chatbot-core/data/raw/`)

**To run:**
```bash
python data/collection/discourse_topics_retriever.py
```

### 2. Filter topics

**Script**: `collection_utils/filter_discourse_threads.py`

Filters the previously collected topics, keeping only those with an accepted answer.

- **Input**: `discourse_topic_list.json`
- **Output**: `filtered_discourse_topics.json` (stored in `chatbot-core/data/raw`)

**To run:**
```bash
python data/collection/collection_utils/filter_discourse_threads.py
```

### 3. Fetch post content

**Script**: `discourse_fetch_posts.py`

Fetches all post content for each filtered topic, including the question and all replies.

- **Input**: `filtered_discourse_topics.json` 
- **Output**: `topics_with_posts.json` (stored in `chatbot-core/data/raw`)

**To run:**
```bash
python data/collection/discourse_fetch_posts.py
```

## StackOverflow Threads

This script processes data collected manually from StackOverflow using [StackExchange Data Explorer](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/new). The query retrieves the top 1000 Jenkins-related threads with accepted answers, positive scores, and created in or after 2020.

### 1. Export the CSV from StackExchange

Run the following SQL query in the [StackExchange Data Explorer](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/new) to export a list of high-quality Jenkins-related threads:

```sql
SELECT TOP 1000
    q.Id AS [Question ID],
    q.Title AS [Question Title],
    q.Body AS [Question Body],
    q.Tags AS [Tags],
    q.CreationDate,
    q.Score AS [Question Score],
    a.Id AS [Accepted Answer ID],
    a.Score AS [Answer Score],
    a.Body AS [Answer Body]
FROM Posts q
INNER JOIN Posts a ON q.AcceptedAnswerId = a.Id
WHERE
    q.Tags LIKE '%<jenkins>%'
    AND q.Score >= 1
    AND q.CreationDate >= '2020-01-01'
ORDER BY q.Score DESC
```

The result can be downloaded as aCSV file and have to be placed in the following path: ```chatbot-core/data/raw/QueryResults.csv```

### 2. Convert CSV to JSON

**Script**: `collection_utils/convert_stack_threads.py`

This script reads the exported CSV and converts it into a JSON format. The resulting JSON file will contain a list of question-answer pairs with metadata.

- **Input**: `QueryResults.csv` 
- **Output**: `stack_overflow_threads.json` (stored in `chatbot-core/data/raw`)

**To run:**
```bash
python data/collection/collection_utils/convert_stack_threads.py
```
## Jenkins Plugins

This pipeline fetches the documentation content of the Jenkins plugins hosted on [https://plugins.jenkins.io/](https://plugins.jenkins.io/).

The collection process consists of two main scripts:

### 1. Retrieve plugin names

**Script**: `fetch_list_plugins.py`

Fetches the list of all available plugins from the [Jenkins update site](https://updates.jenkins.io/experimental/latest/) and saves their names (without `.hpi` extension).

- **Output**: `plugin_names.json` (stored in `chatbot-core/data/raw`)

**To run:**
```bash
python data/collection/fetch_list_plugins.py
```

### 2. Fetch plugin documentation

**Script**: `jenkins_plugin_fetch.py`

Uses the list of plugin names to fetch documentation content from each plugin's page on [plugins.jenkins.io](https://plugins.jenkins.io). It extracts the main `<div class="content">` section from each page, which contains the content we are interested in.

- **Input**: `plugin_names.json`
- **Output**: `plugin_docs.json` (stored in `chatbot-core/data/raw`)

**To run:**
```bash
python data/collection/jenkins_plugin_fetch.py
```
